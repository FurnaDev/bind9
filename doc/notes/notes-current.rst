Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~

- If signatures created by the ZSK are expired, and the ZSK private key is offline,
  allow the expired signatures to be replaced with signatures created by the KSK.
  :gl:`#3049`

- On FreeBSD, a TCP connection would leak a small amount of heap memory leading
  to out-of-memory problem in a long run. This has been fixed. :gl:`#3051`

- Under certain circumstances, the signed version of an inline-signed
  zone could be dumped to disk without the serial number of the unsigned
  version of the zone, preventing resynchronization of zone contents
  after ``named`` restart in case the unsigned zone file gets modified
  while ``named`` is not running. This has been fixed. :gl:`#3071`
