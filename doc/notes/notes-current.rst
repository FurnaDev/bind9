Notes for BIND 9.17.17
----------------------

Security Fixes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Named failed to check the opcode of responses when performing refresh,
  stub updates, and UPDATE forwarding.  This could lead to an assertion
  failure under particular conditions.  This has been addressed by checking
  the opcode of those responses and rejecting the messages if they don't
  match the expected value. :gl:`#2762`

- Fix an assertion failure that occured in ``named`` when attempting to send
  a UDP packet exceeding the MTU size if rate-limiting was enabled.
  (CVE-2021-25218) :gl:`#2839`

Known Issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- None.

New Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- It is now possible to set a hard quota on the number of concurrent DoH
  connections, and the number of active HTTP/2 streams per connection,
  by using the ``http-listener-clients`` and ``http-streams-per-connection``
  options, or the ``listener-clients`` and ``streams-per-connection``
  parameters to an ``http`` statement. The defaults are 300 and 100
  respectively. :gl:`#2809`

Removed Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- None.

Feature Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- DNS over HTTPS support can be disabled at the compile time via the new
  configuration option ``--disable-doh``.  This allows BIND 9 to be
  compiled without libnghttp2 library. :gl:`#2478`

- Memory allocation has been substantially refactored, and is now based on
  the memory allocation API provided by the `jemalloc` library on platforms
  where it is available. This library is now recommended for building BIND 9.
  :gl:`#2433`

- Previously, named accepted FORMERR responses both with and without
  an OPT record, as an indication that a given server did not support
  EDNS. To implement full compliance with RFC 6891, only FORMERR
  responses without an OPT record are now accepted. This intentionally
  breaks communication with servers that do not support EDNS and
  that incorrectly echo back the query message with the RCODE field
  set to FORMERR and the QR bit set to 1. :gl:`#2249`

- CDS and CDNSKEY records may now be published in a zone without the
  requirement that they exactly match an existing DNSKEY record, so long
  the zone is signed with an algorithm represented in the CDS or CDNSKEY
  record.  This allows a clean rollover from one DNS provider to another
  when using a multiple-signer DNSSEC configuration. :gl:`#2710`

Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~

- Testing revealed that setting the thread affinity on both the netmgr
  and netthread threads led to inconsistent recursive performance, as
  sometimes the netmgr and netthread threads competed over a single
  resource.

  When the affinity is not set, tests show a slight dip in the authoritative
  performance of around 5% (ranging from 3.8% to 7.8%), but
  the recursive performance is now consistently improved. :gl:`#2822`
